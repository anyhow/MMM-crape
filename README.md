# MMM-scrape

This is supposed to become a module for Magic Mirror which scrapes a custom part of a remote site based on a DOM selector.

Not working.



```javascript


    {
        module: 'MMM-scrape',
        position: 'top_left',
        config: {
                url: "http://fm4.orf.at/player/live",
                domselector: "span.playing"
                }
    },


```
